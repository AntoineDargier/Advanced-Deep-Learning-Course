# Deep Learning interpretability with GradCAM

### Goal
Visualization of a CNN to highlight the regions of the input image that were important for the neural network prediction.

### Language
```Python```

### Contents
1. Download the ResNet model
2. Load input images
3. Compute the GradCAM
4. Visualization

### Librarires
* ```Pytorch```
* ```torchvision```
* ```wget```
* ```matplotlib```
* ```numpy```

### Conclusion
Grad-CAM is a powerful tool for visualizing the important regions in an image that a CNN uses to make a prediction. It provides an effective way to interpret and understand the decision-making process of CNNs, which is especially useful for improving model transparency and debugging performance issues. By using Grad-CAM, I can gain a deeper understanding of how CNNs work, and ultimately improve their performance in real-world applications.
