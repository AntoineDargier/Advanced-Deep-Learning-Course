# Advanced-Deep-Learning-Course
Deep Learning projects (CS x MVA), Spring 2023

### Projects
1. Hyper-parameters and training basics: Test different architectures (impact of the learning rate, optimizer, loss function) of Deep Learning models on three problems: classification, multilabel classification and regression.
2. Deep Learning interpretability with GradCAM: Visualization of a CNN to highlight the regions of the input image that were important for the neural network prediction.
3. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Node (multi-level) classification task: predict the correct node's labels for a given PPI graph.
4. Transfer Learning: Use of Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation to improve challenging contexts, in which few data and resources are available.
5. Koopman Decomposition: Describe the dynamics of a non-linear dynamical system by means of the Koopman theory.
6. Generative Models: Use generative models (GANs, VAEs, Normalizing flows) to generate more data or better understand the data at hand. Mathematical understanding.
